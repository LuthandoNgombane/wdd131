            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Luthando Ngombane, and I was born in Mthatha, South Africa. I am currently working as a Full Stack Web Developer at 360 Administration and Systems, where I specialize in building and maintaining both front-end and back-end web applications. Alongside my professional role, I am pursuing a degree in BASc in Software Development through BYU-Idaho, balancing my studies with my career to deepen my expertise in the field. I am passionate about coding, technology, and continuously improving my skills in both legacy tools and the latest tech tools available, this allows me to be able to help maintain legacy code and be flexible enough to innovate in within the latest trends.</p>
